# Layer 3

You might of heard of Layer 2 (L2) solutions which have been instrumental in addressing challenges of L1 chains like Ethereum, offering faster transactions and reduced costs compared to the base Layer 1 (L1) chains like Ethereum. But as ecosystems evolve, specialized needs arise, prompting the emergence of Layer 3 (L3) solutions.

**Layer 3 blockchain** build on the foundation of L2 by introducing additional scalability and tailored functionalities. Designed for specific use cases, L3 solutions provide:

- Ultra-High Scalability: Handling a greater volume of transactions at lower costs.
- Customization: Features optimized for unique ecosystems like gaming, DeFi, or metaverse projects.
- Seamless Interoperability: Enhanced communication between blockchain networks.

## ApeChain: An Optimistic L3 

ApeChain, as an Optimistic L3 built on Arbitrum Orbit and uses rollup technology to assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise, allowing for fast transaction confirmations and efficient scaling. This makes it ideal for applications requiring high throughput and low transaction costs. For more details, you can check out the [ApeChain Architecture](https://docs.apechain.com/architecture). This innovative approach involves bundling multiple transactions into a single batch, which is processed and verified on the main Ethereum chain, ensuring security while offloading computational work to the L3.

What sets ApeChain apart is its integration with the Arbitrum stack, allowing it to benefit from Arbitrum's security and infrastructure while maintaining independence. This setup not only enhances the utility of ApeCoin as its native gas token but also fosters a dynamic economy within the ApeCoin ecosystem. For developers this mean leveraging the efficiencies of multiple programming languages with Arbitrum's Stylus, a feature of ApeChain's architecture.

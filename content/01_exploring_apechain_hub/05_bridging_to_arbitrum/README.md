## What is a Bridge?

A crypto bridge is a tool that enables the transfer of assets across different blockchain networks. It serves as a connection point, allowing users to move liquidity seamlessly between chains. With a user-friendly interface, crypto bridges make it easy for individuals to interact and transfer assets between platforms. Features often include customizable branding, clear navigation, and the ability to support transfers between various blockchains, enhancing the overall blockchain ecosystem.

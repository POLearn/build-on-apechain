# ðŸš€ Quest: Deploy Your First NFT Contract  

Now we understood more about the NFT. Let begin this quest and deploy your very own NFT contract on ApeChain. But before deploying, letâ€™s personalize the NFT contract to make it yours.  

1. Change the contract **name** to `PolApeNFT`.  
2. Update the **symbol** to `PAN`.  

In your IDE, ensure the compiler is set to **v0.8.26**. Using the correct version ensures compatibility with your contract code.

Once's that is compiled. From the list of contracts, select **`ApeNFT.sol`** for deployment.

You can deploy the contract. Make sure to add an initialOwner. This can be anyone, but typically it'll be the deployer address. once that done, click on deploy.

Complete the quest by submitting your transaction details to **Proof of Learn (PoL)**. This is your proof that youâ€™ve successfully deployed the contract!  

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve deployed your first NFT contract on ApeChain. In the next section, weâ€™ll going to mint your an NFT on ApeChain.

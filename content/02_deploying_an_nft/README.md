You’ve probably heard of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)—the iconic collection of NFTs that has taken the world by storm. But did you know that BAYC isn’t just about collecting cool digital art? It’s also the backbone of the ApeCoin ecosystem, with $APE serving as the native token for the community. And to supercharge this ecosystem, we have ApeChain, a blockchain that enhances the utility of ApeCoin and fosters a thriving, dynamic economy.

ApeChain is more than just a blockchain; it’s the platform that brings the BAYC community together, offering developers and users the ability to build and interact with applications that leverage BAYC’s intellectual property. One great example of this is the "Made By Apes" initiative—a collection of builders using BAYC’s IP across various brands, products, and services, all made possible through ApeChain’s innovative infrastructure.

In this section of the course, we’ll dive into the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We’ll explore what makes NFTs so fascinating, why they’ve become a cultural phenomenon, and, most excitingly, how you can create and deploy your very own NFTs on ApeChain.
